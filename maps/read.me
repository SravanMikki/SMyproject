map[keyType]valueType - syntax
example :- scores:= map[string]int{
}
Keys Must Be Unique:
Each key in a map can only have one value. If you assign a new value to an existing key, it overwrites the old value.
Keys Can Be Any Comparable Type:
Keys can be strings, integers, floats, etc., but not slices, maps, or functions (because those canâ€™t be compared with ==).
Values Can Be Anything:
Values can be any type: numbers, strings, structs, even other maps!
Dynamic Size:
Maps grow as you add more key-value pairs, unlike arrays with fixed sizes.
Deleting Items:
Use the delete function to remove a key-value pair.
using for(loop) syntax:- for key, value := range mapName {}
