Functions:
Syntax: func name(params) returnType { code }.
Parameters: Inputs you give the function (can be pointers or values).
Return: Use return to send back a result (optional—can return nothing).

Pointers: Like giving someone your house key (address) instead of moving your whole house to them. They can go to your house and change stuff with the key.
Functions: Like a vending machine—put in coins (parameters), press a button (call it), and get a snack (return value). With pointers, the machine can also restock your coins directly.

methods: - func (receiverName ReceiverType) methodName(params) returnType {syntax}
receiverName: A variable name for the instance of the type (like d for a Dog).
ReceiverType: The type the method belongs to (e.g., Dog or *Dog).
